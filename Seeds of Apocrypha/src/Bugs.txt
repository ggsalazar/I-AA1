Really funky v-sync issue when creatures are moving; more prevalent when moving faster
Diagonal movement too fast (sqrt2, or 1.414)

Yes/No buttons not removing elements like they should in character creation
Portrait seems a touch small on laptop
When res_scale is set to 2x, not entire debug room can be seen, even though it *should* be

At some point may want to refine pathfinding algorithm so it doesn't get right up on the edge of unwalkable tiles
