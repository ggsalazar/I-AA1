Debugging:  -Make sure Text (e.g. Main Menu text) is *actually* being centered
			-Getting pixel distortion when changing resolutions from fullscreen (4x base) to smaller (3x, 1x) (still true on smaller monitors?)

Tutorial - Pause menu, get party members moving, add in NPCs

General - Should use visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv

	-Establish magic and tech coexist, then illustrate that magic is going *wrong*, and how and why that's a problem

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits?
