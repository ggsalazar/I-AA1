Left off: Character creation - Each option in CC should open a sub-menu that allows the player to pick details of their character
								
To-do:
	-Add Width parameter to Text::SetStr that will add in a newline character if the string exceeds a 
	 specified pixel width (default argument is window width)
	-Make Pre-Made characters and the option to add them to party
	-Where should Tutorial button go? What about rules/manual?

Main Menu
	-Character creation
		--In the middle, descriptive text of the thing being picked & the options the player can pick from (maybe implemented primed for pickers)
		--Also in the middle(?), whatever sub-thing they are picking (aesthetics, features, skills, etc.)
		--On the right, the character currently being made/characters already made
		--Pre-Gen characters
		--Random characters
		--CreatePartyMember in Scene.cpp
	-Continue/Load game
		--Will require implementation of saving/loading system
	-Options
		--Set resolution/fullscreen
		--Change volumes
		--Automatic journalling
Tutorial

Game starts on train! Train heist
	-Establish magic and tech coexist, then illustrate that magic is going *wrong*, and how and why that's a problem
