Left Off - A* not working correctly, need to see why and what to do to fix

Tutorial - Get party members moving, Change camera zoom, add in NPCs

General - Visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv
		 -May want to consider going back to 32x32 tiles for performance reasons

	-Establish magic and tech coexist, then illustrate that magic is going *wrong*, and how and why that's a problem

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits?
