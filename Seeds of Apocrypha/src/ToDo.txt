Left off: Tutorial - Get party members moving, add in NPCs, (de)select party members

TileMap - at some point, I will need to get the data of which tile is being looked at/stood on, since different types of terrain have different properties, such as elevation

Game starts on train! Train heist
	-Establish magic and tech coexist, then illustrate that magic is going *wrong*, and how and why that's a problem
	 all within first 1-2 hours! Then expand on those two things throughout the rest of the game

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits?
