General - Visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv
		- At some point going to have to adjust pathfinding to account for different elevations
		- Stealth???
		- Sentient creatures have separate head and body sprites (for customization)
		- Difficulty for now is restricted to # of party members; future installments may have more granular difficulty settings

	-Have UI elements set their own Sprite
	-Allow for custom UI arrangement
	-Swimming
	-Pickpocketing
	-Temporary party members/allies
	-More traps
