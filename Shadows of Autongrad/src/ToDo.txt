SDL:	-Waiting to implement Music & SFX until SDL_mixer 3.0 releases

Tutorial:	-Move to node closest to target if possible; if not return NOACTION
				--Modify FindPath() to find closest target node to goal from given creature's position;
				  if target is too far from goal (> 1.5M) return empty V2i
					---This only needs to be done if target is NOT a tile
			-Add in NPCs
				--Dialogue system/trees
				--Blacksmith
					---Shopping (after implementing inventory)
				--Quest Giver
			-Fix camera clamping in Scene.cpp
			-Interfaces
				--Quest Journal
				--Map
					---Area Map
					---World Map
				--Character sheet/s
				--Inventory

General - Visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv
		- At some point going to have to adjust pathfinding to account for different elevations
		- Sentient creatures have separate head and body sprites (for customization)
		- Change from nodes to NavMesh?

Main Menu
	-Character creation
		--On the left, list of traits to pick (Race, Ability Scores, class features, etc.)
		--When one of these is selected and sub-menu is opened, sub-menu replaces and hides list
		--In the center, in the same (general) layout as the in-game char sheet, is their in-progress build
		--On the right, the character currently being made + characters already made
		--Pre-Gen characters set stats but can still be modified
		--CreatePartyMember in Scene.cpp
		--Automatic journalling
		--Automatic dungeon mapping
		--Back/Exit
			---Confirm
			---Delete created characters/wipe slate clean
	-Continue/Load game
		--Will require implementation of saving/loading

Prologue
	-Train
		--Intro "Cutscene"
		--NPCs
		--Bad guys
			---How many?
			---Spacing?
			---Boss?
			---Motives?
				----Connection to overarching plot?

Game starts on train! Train heist
	-Establish magic and tech coexist, then illustrate that magic is going *wrong*, and how and why that's a problem
	 all within first hour! Then expand on those two things throughout the rest of the game

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits? How to navigate easily?

Future Improvements/Sequel ideas:
	-Reduce the use of smart pointers, ideally to 0
	-Have UI elements set their own Sprite
	-Adjustable zoom (difficult to get right in a pixel art game)
	-Allow for custom UI arrangement
	-Swimming
	-Pickpocketing
	-Temporary party members/allies
	-NavMesh instead of grid
