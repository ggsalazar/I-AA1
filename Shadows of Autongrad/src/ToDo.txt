Prologue
	-Train
		--Intro "Cutscene"
		--NPCs
		--Bad guys
			---How many?
			---Spacing?
			---Boss?
			---Motives?
				----Connection to overarching plot?
PartyMember
	-SetPortraitPosition()

Game starts on train! Train heist
	-Establish magic and tech coexist, then illustrate that magic is going *wrong*, and how and why that's a problem
	 all within first hour! Then expand on those two things throughout the rest of the game

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits?

Future Improvements/Sequel ideas:
	-Reduce the use of smart pointers, ideally to 0
	-Have UI elements set their own Sprite
	-Adjustable zoom (difficult to get right in a pixel art game)
	-Allow for custom UI arrangement
	-Swimming
	-Pickpocketing
