SDL:	-Waiting to implement Music & SFX until SDL_mixer 3.0 releases
Devlog: -Pathfinding (w + w/o smoothing)
		-Dialogue/Yggdrasil


Tutorial:	-Left off dicking around with Debug_dialogue
			-May need to build GUI Yggdrasil...
			-Yggdrasil:
				--Visual feedback when selecting a choice
					---Make background of dialogue box more opaque (.8)
				--CONDITIONS
					---Checks for:
						----Money
						----Disposition
						----Reputation?
						----Not least of all, flags
					---Skill checks :)
				--Changing nodes based on flags
					---Do simple test quest
				--How to store/display old text?
			-Dialogue system/trees
				--Each piece of text MUST have:
					---Speaker
					---The string
					---Choices
						----The string (inherently states if doesn't progress dialogue via ?)
						----Condition(s)
						----Effect(s)
						----Color changes when moused over/condition not met
							-----1. Draw all choices
								------Include their condition(s) if applicable
							-----2. Gray out and strike through the ones for which the condition is not met
				--Each piece of text CAN have:
					---Condition(s)
					---Effects(s)
				--How to set dialogue node each time character is spoken to?
					---Needs to be saved and then loaded?
					---Determined dynamically via location and flags
			-Place spawn points in maps in Tiled so they don't have to manually be set in Scene
			 (can be pulled from TileMap after area is fully loaded)
			-Combat
				--Just a quick lil sum'sum - 1 melee-only creature against the 1 party member
			-NPCs
				--Blacksmith
					---Shopping (after implementing inventory)
				--Quest Giver
			-Interfaces
				--Quest Journal
				--Map
					---Area Map
					---World Map
				--Character sheet/s
				--Inventory
			-More Combat
				--A creature with ranged options
			-area changing
			-fog of war
			-multi-party member spawning, movement, & cam locking
				--Party formations
					---Grid, but what size?
			-Intro cutscene
			-Tutorialization

General - Visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv
		- At some point going to have to adjust pathfinding to account for different elevations
		- Sentient creatures have separate head and body sprites (for customization)
		- Difficulty for now is restricted to # of party members; future installments may have more granular difficulty settings

Main Menu
	-Character creation
		--On the left, list of traits to pick (Race, Ability Scores, class features, etc.)
			---When one of these is selected and sub-menu is opened, sub-menu replaces and hides list
		--In the center, in the same (general) layout as the in-game char sheet, is their in-progress build
		--On the right, the character currently being made + characters already made
		--Pre-Gen characters set stats but can still be modified
		--CreatePartyMember in Scene.cpp
		--Automatic journalling
			---Inform player of intention and ask them if they are certain (Confirm box)
		--Automatic dungeon mapping
			---Inform player of intention and ask them if they are certain (Confirm box)
		--Back/Exit
			---Confirm
			---Delete created characters/wipe slate clean
	-Continue/Load game
		--Saving/loading
Tutorial
	-Town

				----Spells
					-----Magic
						------I&A Arcanist

Prologue
	-Train
		--Intro "Cutscene"
		--NPCs
		--Bad guys
			---How many?
			---Spacing?
			---Boss?
			---Motives?
				----Connection to overarching plot?

Game starts on train! Train heist
	-Establish magic and tech coexist
	-Establish central conflict
		--Alchemist distributing new drug
			---Why?
			---Connection to larget plot/sequel
			---Who is s/he working for?
			---BG1 Iron Crisis for inspiration

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits? How to navigate easily?

Future Improvements/Sequel ideas:
	-Have UI elements set their own Sprite
	-Allow for custom UI arrangement
	-Swimming
	-Pickpocketing
	-Temporary party members/allies
	-NavMesh instead of grid
	-More traps
