General - Visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv
		- At some point going to have to adjust pathfinding to account for different elevations
		- Sentient creatures have separate head and body sprites (for customization)
		- Difficulty for now is restricted to # of party members; future installments may have more granular difficulty settings

Character creation
