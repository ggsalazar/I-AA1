General - Visual signifiers to show when an attack/action is at (dis)adv
		- At some point going to have to adjust pathfinding to account for different elevations
		- Sentient creatures have separate head and body sprites (for customization)

Main Menu
	-Character creation
		--On the left, list of traits to pick (Race, Ability Scores, class features, etc.)
			---When one of these is selected and sub-menu is opened, sub-menu replaces and hides list

		--On the right, the character currently being made + characters already made
		--Pre-Gen characters set stats but can still be modified
		--CreatePartyMember in Scene.cpp
		--Automatic journalling

Prologue
	-Train
		--Intro "Cutscene"
		--NPCs
		--Bad guys
			---How many?
			---Spacing?
			---Boss?
			---Motives?
				----Connection to overarching plot?

Game starts on train! Train heist
	-Establish magic and tech coexist
	-Establish central conflict
		--Alchemist distributing new drug

			---Connection to larget plot/sequel

Portraits - use a single texture that contains all portraits? How to navigate easily?

Future Improvements/Sequel ideas:
	-Have UI elements set their own Sprite
	-Allow for custom UI arrangement
	-Swimming
	-Pickpocketing
	-Temporary party members/allies
	-NavMesh instead of grid
	-More traps
