DrawRect collision check isn't working right

Path smoothing working, but not quite registering unwalkable tiles quite right
	-Because I'm only inserting the *last* node into the smoothed path, it isn't checking the tiles inbetween

	-Implement path smoothing
		--Currently stuck in infinite loop when doing this
			---Review the code and see where the logic fails; rewrite it yourself
