Yes/No buttons not removing elements like they should in character creation

Sliders are broken

Interface being drawn over buttons because menus are drawn after sprites
	-Do ALL of the entities really need to be drawn by Scene? Does Scene even really need to keep track of all the entities? 
	 Why not let menus handle their own entities holistically (this would also make reducing reliance on smart pointers easier)?
